#+TITLE: PyQT Data App
#+AUTHOR: Brandon Guttersohn

This skeleton serves as the starting point for PyQT applications built
around reading/plotting data. It includes a basic QApplication with a
MainWindow, some buttons, and some other junk.

Basically, copy/paste the code into a new repo and work from there.

*Checklist*
- [ ] Rename =modulename= to the Python module name you want
- [ ] Rename ApplicationName to the name of the class you want for
  your QApplication derivative.
